# 🌐 Static Website CI/CD Pipeline with AWS

This project demonstrates how to deploy a static website to Amazon S3 using a fully automated CI/CD pipeline powered by **GitHub**, **AWS CodePipeline**, and **Amazon S3**.

## 🚀 What I Built

I created a basic static HTML website and automated its deployment to an S3 bucket using AWS Developer Tools. Every time I push code to the connected GitHub repository, the latest version of the site is automatically deployed.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **AWS CodePipeline** – CI/CD orchestration
- **AWS S3** – Hosting the static website
- **GitHub** – Source code repository
- **AWS IAM** – Role and permission management
